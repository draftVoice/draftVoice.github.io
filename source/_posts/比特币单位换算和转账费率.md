Example response:

{ "fastestFee": 40, "halfHourFee": 20, "hourFee": 10 }
```

* fastestFee: The lowest fee (in satoshis per byte) that will currently result in the fastest transaction confirmations (usually 0 to 1 block delay).
* halfHourFee: The lowest fee (in satoshis per byte) that will confirm transactions within half an hour (with 90% probability).
* hourFee: The lowest fee (in satoshis per byte) that will confirm transactions within an hour (with 90% probability).
